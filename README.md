## Installing Alohomora
Before installing Alohomora, make sure you are booted into Breakpoint. Instructions on how to do so are linked [here](https://sites.google.com/view/breakpointguide).

### Step 1
While booted into Breakpoint, download the extension onto your Chromebook from the [Alohomora Github Release Page](https://github.com/KC728/alohomora/releases). Click "Source Code (zip)" under the latest release. The extension should now download onto your Chromebook.

### Step 2
Type "chrome://extensions" into the URL bar. Turn on the "Developer Mode" switch in the upper right hand corner. Then, click on "Load Unpacked." A file prompt window should now appear. 

### Step 3
A file prompt window should now be visible, showing your downloads folder. Right-click on the Alohomora extension file, which will be a greyed-out .zip file named "alohomora-1.x.zip" or something similar. An unzipped folder should now appear. Double-click the unzipped folder, then click once on the folder inside. Finally, click the "Open" button, located on the bottom right of the file prompt window. This will install the extension.

### Step 4
Once your extension is unpacked and installed, click on "Keyboard shortcuts". To set your shortcuts, click on the pencil and copy the shortcut listed on the left. You can also set them as your own shortcuts to your preferred shortcuts. I suggest leaving the Ctrl+U shortcut unfilled, as this can cause issues when using apps such as Google Docs, and is not necessary except for developers.

### Step 5
Open a new tab, either using the new tab button or Ctrl+T. You should now see the Alohomora menu page. If needed, click twice on the window icon on the far top-right corner to enter fullscreen, eliminating the small white space on the bottom. Congratulations! You are now booted Alohomora. If this is your first time using Alohomora, proceed to [First Time Setup](https://sites.google.com/view/breakpointguide/first-time-setup).
